# Task-5
# **Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark**

## **Objective**
Captured live network packets and identified key protocols to understand network behavior.

## **Tools Used**
- **Wireshark** (Free, available at [https://www.wireshark.org/](https://www.wireshark.org/))

## **What Was Done**
1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Started packet capture on the active network interface.
3. Generated network traffic by browsing a website and sending ping requests.
4. Stopped the capture after collecting sufficient data.
5. Applied filters to analyze specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).
6. Identified at least three different protocols present in the capture.
7. Saved the captured traffic as a `.pcap` file.
8. Summarized findings in a short report detailing observed protocols.
